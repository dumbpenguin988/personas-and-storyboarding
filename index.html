          If you are a fitness newbie and go to the gym for your very first workout session, it is very likely
          that you are immediately overwhelmed at the first glance of the miscellany of wierdly-shaped pieces of
          machinery. The gym is filled with loud music, the smell of sweats, and muscular men and build women playing
          with these equipments like a violin. You, on the other hand, are cluelessly standing in the midst of all of this mess.
          Which ones should you go to? How do you know which ones are more advanced than the others? How do you know which equipments are for which
          parts of your body?... <br><br>
          This project delves into the design of a FUNCTIONAl TRAINER, a common type of equipment in the gym. How does it work?
          Is it intuitive to learn? How does it compare to other training facilities of similar purposes? Is it safe to use?

          A functional trainer is a versatile piece of gym equipment that people use for functional training, i.e., working out specific parts 
          of their muscles. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are various forms of functional trainers, and this project focuses on the wall-mounted types that are present in the 
          Nelson fitness center of Brown University. However different two functional trainers might seem, their essential composition 
          remain consistent: main body and attachments.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    The main body of a functional trainer consists of the following:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A <b>verticle pole</b> mounted on the wall and/or ground that has slots at different heights for the pulley.</li>
                    <li>An <b>adjustable pulley</b>: 
                      <ul>
                        <li>The pulley can be fixed in one of the slots on the pole with the bolt. The bolt can be pulled
                          against the pole so that the user can slide the pulley up or down. As the pulley is repositioned to a desired height, the user 
                          lets go of the bolt so that the bolt goes into the new slot.</li> 
                        <li> The cable mounted on the pulley connects to a hook, where mounts the attachments.</li>  
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>A <b>resistance-setting device</b>. The user is free to adjust how 
                      much resistance they would like on the other side of the cable to pull against.
                      In the above functional trainer, there are two yellow buttons on the wall to set the resistance up and down. 
                      A display shows the current resistance.

          From the description above, we can agree that the functional trainer is quite complex with multiple parts. 
          How, then, do different users interact with it? <br>
          In this study of the functional trainer, I have raised the following questions for users. To investigate into 
          this question, we want to consider a diversity of users coming from different background.
          I observed and interviewed three people who are respectively a first-time user (A), a casual gym-goer (B), and a frequent user (C).

                It also protects knees compared to doing squatting. <br>

                has the advantage of being safe, as doing weight-lifting always entails the danger of dropping the heavy dumbbells.

          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>First-time users prefer to consult a professional source like a coach on how they should use the functional trainer, considering not only 
                the complexity of the equipment but also their need to customize the facility according to specific training goals.
              </li>
              <li>Once familiar with its function, users find the functional trainer a versatile and important training facility in the gym that they use
                on different parts of their body. The adjustable pulley and various attachments grant tremendous flexibility to the equipment.
              </li>
              <li>It is difficult to move the pulley when it gets up high on the pole, especially for people of shorter stature.</li>
              <li>All three users find the display confusing as it is unclear what the parameters mean and what units are used. The buttons to adjust the resistance
                are detached from the display board, making their purpose more ambiguous.
              </li>
              <li>The users specifically note that there is another type of functional trainer that uses a weight stack as the source of resistance (as shown in picture).
                They indicate that the weight stack serves as a strong visual cue for the purpose of the equipment. The weight stacks also has clear numerical values with units (lbs)
                labeled so they specifically know how much resistance they are working out against. </li>

                <br>Amanda is a female university student who has been regularly working out in the gym before, but she is unfamiliar with this new gym she is going to now
                since she moved to another location.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>The problems that Amanda faces are twofold. a) She has always been using functional trainers that use weight stacks as resistance, so she does not
                  know how to adjust resistance on this equipment. The confusing layout of the display and the detachment of the buttons from the display also adds to this problem.
                  b) it is difficult for her to slide the pulley to the top of the pole as she is not very tall.
                </li>
                <li>Amanda represents user A and B from the interview and observation as someone who is relatively new to the facility.</li>
